# Second-price-auction-algorithm-based-on-total-Profit-maximization
##### Comparison of Three Algorithms

This algorithm will be compared with the other two algorithms (the second price auction algorithm and the first price auction algorithm). Through the Control variates, it will verify that the cumulative total profits of the three algorithms change with the number of auction rounds, the cumulative total profits change with the number of MDs, and the cumulative total profits change with the number of UAVs, where MDs represent buyers, and UAVs represent sellers and auctioneers.

##### Algorithm chart of second price auction based on total Profit maximization

And in this experiment, we also verified that this algorithm (the second price auction algorithm based on total Profit maximization) changes with the number of auction rounds, and the cumulative profits of buyers, sellers, and cumulative total profits.

##### Winner Average Bid and Average Actual Payment Chart

Finally, the authenticity of the auction algorithm was ensured through the average bidding and actual payment graph of the winners, verifying that the algorithm in this paper determines the winner based on the maximum total profit, and does not determine the winner based on bidding. Therefore, it provides a chance to win for smaller tasks and is closer to reality.

##### notes:

The src folder corresponds to two types of simulation graphs. One is the graph of the accumulated profits of buyers, sellers, and total profits of the algorithm as the number of auction rounds changes. The other is the graph of the average bidding and actual payment of winners to verify the authenticity of the auction algorithm.

The compare folder corresponds to the comparison chart between this algorithm (the second price auction algorithm based on total Profit maximization) and the other two algorithms (the second price auction algorithm and the first price auction algorithm).
